    <h2>Instant Cup Noodles</h2>
    <p>
      Typically, cup noodles are very easy to make. They usually have soup. You
      will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>kettle</li>
      <li>your cup noodles</li>
      <li>utensils, if you want</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        alt="fancy kettle"
      />
      <li>
        boil water with your kettle. I'm more used to electric kettles so it
        might be different for you.
      </li>

        alt="noodles again dang it so much noodles I can't type this anymore"
      />
      <li>
        there should be some seasoning packets in the cup as well as a fork.
        open the seasoning and put in on the noodles. If there is no packet, you
        can skip this step

      <li>
        after the boiling, insert the hot water into the cup noodles. There
        should be a line in the cup to tell you where to stop. If there isn't,
        the water should be just a few inches above the noodles.
      </li>

    <h2>Instant Noodle Soup</h2>
    <p>
      This is your average type of instant noodle. It is fast and easy. They
      have soup, just like cup noodles. Some don't have soup, but we'll cover
      that in the next section. You will need:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>pot with water</li>
      <li>your instant noodles</li>
      <li>bowl and spoon, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        get your pot and fill it with water. then heat it until it is boiling.
        this water will eventually be your soup, so put whatever's right for
        you.
