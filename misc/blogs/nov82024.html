        worst case scenario is someone i know irl will see this and approach me about it. i hate it. please dont because anything here isnt worth your time to talk about and itll make it worse. thiss is kinda like my journal btu online. i dont know why i did this. arent blogs supposed to be about this website? man f this website lmao. ill probably have to remove everything compoletely when the time comes. the more time passes the more i want to remove myself from everything. im not that good looking, thats why its kind of comforting to not be someone who has to  be in a picture or have ppl ask me if its okay if im in it. i know looks arent everything but idk maybe kinda/? why am i talking about this im literally slouched over my back typing this in my computer as i type this i am not a person to talk about looks and insecurities.
