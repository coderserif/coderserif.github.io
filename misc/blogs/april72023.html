        i looked at the old website and thought,... hm, this looks kinda terrible. then i realized that THAT design was the best that i can do. planned everything out and all that. realized how stupid it looks so idk i kinda got bored and remade the thing, got real goofy, now THIS design is making me rethink everything. idk what i want for this website anymore. all of this is just so stupid. at least i have the ability to make things like this, but a lazk of motivation will get the best of me. even the comix website hasnt been updatedfor a while (made purely because of procrastinating in school). it wanst rly healthy, so why continue it?
