    <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        i know im nerding right neow, but zenless zone zero is so peak, its the peakest of peak, and if youre like "ok but have u played ___ blablabla" SHUT UP let me enjoy my peak fiction in peace, ill get to your whatever u want me to play or something, as of writing this, its in the evelyn banner and jjust finished the new special episode w astra (before i forget, those two r gay as hell), theyre so cute and the new year celebration thing is so sweet it makes me forget we're fighting corrupted monsters in the last ever civilization battling against giant dark hollows . umm theres also genshin ig rn the story isnt going as good, i did like the new lantern rite w hu tao i think its cool i actually wish it was permanennt, cus it gave us more of an in depth toward her character and stuff, only downside is lack of VAs whihc i understand, its just a bummer. ok wahte else ummmm even though i probably wont update this in a while, theres new ALNST on the 14th, (which is also ivans adoption day??? like okay) and i am very curiouso on whats gonna happen also TILL IS STILL ALIVE CONFRIEMD REAL NOT FAKE !!!!! 
    </h4>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">okay i dont know if i talked about arcane yet but its also really good, i lov the characters, story is  immmmmaculate, and even though season 2 felt like it couldve been delivered a  lil better, whole story was still enjoyable and alsoo viktor is best character fight me. oh yeah also you really think I needed all the guards at the hexgates? you really think I needed all the guards at the hexgates? you really think I needed all the guards at the hexgates?</h4>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 30px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">okay now time for the music update: ever since december i thinkor late november, BMTH is the only thing thats constantly in my rotation, its so crazy, theyre so cool, makes me forget other bands exist, like theyre whole discography is so crazy and colorful ummm my top fav album rly depends on my mood, like for example if im feeling like a pop girl whoe wants to blast their shit its gotta be the amo album, if im depressed its TTS or NeX GEn, ifim going batshitinsane its the rest of the albums ngl like SURVIVAL HORROR, Sempiternal, There is a Hell, and Suicide Season. i haevent gottenaround listening to CYB but maybe i will one time. anyway tehyre so goated i love them. yk the best part tho, since ive been listening to them so much, when i revisit old artists and songs i used to like, they become as euphoric and enjoyable as they were when i first heard them. constant loop of enjoyment, actually that sounds scary, pretentd i didnt say that. moral of the lesson,  ifi wanna explainmy interests i would take uip multiple hours of your precious time. actually now i kinda feel bad that you read all this, like you didnt even get any new information out of this, all of this text was like reading a boring essay, what are you doing you could literally be doing something else meaningful right now huhhh</h4>
