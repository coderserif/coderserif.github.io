        i think i should put more thought into these things. even though no one reads these i figured id make it worthwhile for me anyway
        currently alone. only now have i truly understood the difference between alone and lonely. its a constant shift between the two sometimes
        oh how hard it is to feel this and i wish i can move on but my stupid moody brain keeps being depressing for no reason !!!
        some good stuffs tho, school nearly done for the year (tho i only have 1 month break its... whatever) im learning a language, and hopefuly i get to master it
        heres some examples ive been cooking up:
        おはよう‼　僕はセリフです。フィリピン人です。　。。。。。。　初めまして。
        so what do you think? btw all those words are just different ways of cursing at someone
        hopefully one day i tell myself, hey, youll be fine. just keep going.
