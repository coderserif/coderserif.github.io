        school is back (for a while now lol) and because things are going just okay for some reason ive decided to up my game in art. like ive been drawing more compared to like last year. hopefully in 10 years it'll be worth when i mayyybe become a good illustrator // artist. i wonder what jobs are there that need me to draw hot anime characters?? or will i have to resort to doing a job that has nothing to do with drawing..? time will tell
