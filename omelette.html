      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
      <li>a tiny slice of butter. maybe 1 gram</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TOOLS YOU WILL NEED</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>frying pan. preferrably a non-stick pan</li>
      <li>a tiny bowl. enough to fit the 2-3 eggs you're having</li>
      <li>spatula. a wooden one. don't want to scrape the pan do we?</li>
      <li>a fork. for mixing</li>
      <li>yourself. can't make omelette without yourself</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>OK NOW IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE OMELETTE</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>crack open your eggs and put all of its contents in your bowl</li>
      <li>
        mix your eggs together with your fork. keep mixing until the eggs has
        completly turned orange
      </li>
      <li>now, season that mix with salt and pepper</li>
      <li>
        now its time to heat your pan. the fire should be pretty small to
        medium.
      </li>
      <li>
        when the pan is relatively hot, put the butter on the pan and lubricate
        the pan. (you'll know the heat's enough when you put your hand on top of
        the pan and it gets a bit hot)
      </li>
      <li>
        after the butter melts and it has been put all over the pan, pour your
        bowl of mixed eggs on the pan
      </li>
      <li>
        wait for about a minute. you can spend this time practicing opening eggs
        with only 1 hand. I can't do that
      </li>
      <li>
        after a minute, fold the omelette in half with your spatula. the
        omelette should look like a half circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        now, you should move the omelette a bit, so it doesn't stick to the pan
        too much. you should also flip the omelette if you want
      </li>
      <li>
        finally, when the omelette's yellow and solid, grab the omelette with
        your spatula and put it on a plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      enjoy your omelette now. best served with whatever you want. maybe bacon
    </p>
