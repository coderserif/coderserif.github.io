my links can be found: <a href="https://coderserif.github.io/links.html">here<a>

this is just the repository for the website. nothing interesting, hey hey i see you trying to peek at the different tabs and the <a href="https://github.com/coderserif/coderserif.github.io/wiki">wiki.<a> look there's nothing ok?

P.S. if you somehow found this, don't download the files and host it for your own. i'm looking at you patrick.
